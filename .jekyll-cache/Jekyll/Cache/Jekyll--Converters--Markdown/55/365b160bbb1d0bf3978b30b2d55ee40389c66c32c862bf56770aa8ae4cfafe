I"–<p>This is a Post I am writing on my travel to the west of India. This time I am in Kutch which is in the north west of the Indian state of Gujarat, itâ€™s a dry region and has a lot of mysteries and rich history dating back to the Indus Valley and Harappan Civilization. More on that in another post. This Post is about an art form called the â€œRogan Artâ€ and as we at thumbprints passionate about handmade original art work we found the right place and a unique art form. Rogan artists donâ€™t use any pen, pencil or tracing paper its straight done on cloth in painting form using a small stick which comes from years and years of painstaking training.</p>
